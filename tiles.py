"""
This module defines the Tile class which is used as the basic unit in a labyrinth. Each Tile represents a square in the
labyrinth and has properties such as its position, size, and whether it has borders on each of its sides.

The Tile class also includes methods for drawing the tile on a tkinter Canvas, including its borders and a turtle image
that can be used to represent a player's position. The turtle's orientation can be changed, and it can be drawn or
erased from the tile.

The module includes a main section that creates a tkinter window and canvas, and draws a single tile on the canvas.

This module is part of a labyrinth project. The project is implemented in Python using the tkinter library for the GUI.

    The Tile class includes methods for initializing the tile, drawing the tile and its borders, updating the visualization
    of a border, calculating the coordinates for borders, rotating the turtle, drawing the turtle, and changing the state
    of the turtle on the tile.
