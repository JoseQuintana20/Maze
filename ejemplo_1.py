"""
This module is part of a labyrinth project. It uses the Grafo class to create a graph representation of a labyrinth.

The graph is created by adding vertices (rooms in the labyrinth) and edges (paths between the rooms). The weight of an
edge determines whether there is a path between two rooms (weight 1) or a wall (weight 0).

After creating the graph, it is printed to the terminal and saved as a JSON file. The JSON file can be used by other
parts of the project, such as the GUI.

This module is intended to be run as a standalone script.
